# analyzing_stroop_effect
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. 

###Background Information
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

###Questions For Investigation

1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? 

3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset.

4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. 

5. Perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level or Type I error associated with your test? What is your conclusion regarding the hypotheses you set up? Did the results match up with your expectations?
